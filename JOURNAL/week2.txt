Week 2

This week I used AI for my daily work, I sent some news screenshots or links 
and asked whether the news was true or not, and at the same time I asked for more 
detailed explanations about the news.

I haven't done Exercise 2 yet, but I plan to use AI as a tutor or assistant 
when I'm struggling, just like I did last week. I really like this approach because 
I'm actually learning, rather than just copying and pasting.
