Week 4

I think I used artificial intelligence enough this week. 
First of all, I placed the crime data in collage park into an excel file,
but some of the data was very messy and needed to be organized. At this point, 
I got help from artificial intelligence, in terms of pasting method and editing.

Secondly, I asked the AI ​​to create an object class and methods for the discussion board. 
As I mentioned in the discussion board, 
I saw that the more detail I provided, the better the results it gave.

However, in my psychology and introductory course, the AI ​​is very helpful with time management. 
I provide it with resources and ask it to provide me with notes to study the course. 
The notes it produces are generally comprehensive and understandable. 
However, after providing the resource, it's crucial to specify exactly what you want and guide the AI. 
If the prompts aren't accurate, the topics I want to study can go off the rails.

Finally, because I missed the lecture for the 326 course this week, 
I wanted to study the material before starting the exercises. 
I provided resources and chapters mentioned on the week's page, and the lecture file.
I asked it to explain the classes and methods to me, relying on these resources, 
as if I had no prior knowledge of the subject. Frankly, it was successful; 
it taught like a real teacher and encouraged me to actively code while teaching.
