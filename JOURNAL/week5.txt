Week 5
This week, I used ChatGPT mainly to support my coursework. For my programming class, I asked it to review and explain some parts of my project code, 
especially when I wasn’t sure if the logic or validation was correct. It helped me identify small errors and understand why certain parts weren’t 
working as expected.

In addition, I used it to summarize and simplify some psychology readings, 
which made it easier for me to study and remember key points before class. Overall, 
it helped me stay more organized and confident with both technical and writing tasks this week.
