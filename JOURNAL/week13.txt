Week 13

This week, I used AI tools as a support resource for my academic work.
I mainly relied on AI to help clarify assignment instructions. AI was useful
for brainstorming ideas, checking structure, I also used AI to help understand
technical concepts by asking follow-up questions when I felt unsure.
I added the areas I used in the Python project to the ai_collaboration file,
I also used it to generate practice questions while preparing for my final exams.
