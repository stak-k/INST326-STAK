Week 7

For the Week 7 exercises, I used the AI ​​as a teacher. 
I really struggled with two or three questions and asked for clarification. 
For Project 02, I asked it to identify problems in my code. I think it's good at finding errors. 
It gave me notes for some of my lessons, which were helpful; it can generate the right type of 
note with the right instructions. Other than that, I didn't use the AI ​​much this week.
